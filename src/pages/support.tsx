            </h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Financial barriers often limit access to quality education and
              mentorship. Your sponsorship can provide students with the
              resources they need to succeed, including access to advanced
              learning materials, workshops, and networking events. Sponsor a
              student today and invest in the future of chemistry.
